									<h2>We’re building the first app that will provide access to the gold-standard treatment for anxiety disorders: CBT.</h2>
								</header>
								<p>CBT is a process that begins with basic psychological education and the creation of a personalized “fear map” to understand how specific triggers, thoughts, and behaviors drive a person’s anxiety. Then patients iteratively learn, practice, and reflect on more adaptive thoughts and behaviors, empowering them to live life without the limitations imposed by anxiety. Currently, patients have to go through months of expensive, face-to-face therapy with a clinician to experience the benefits of CBT.</p>
								<p class="subsection"><b>We’ve operationalized the essential, evidence-based components of CBT that make it so effective.</b> The resulting app will allow users to learn, personalize, and practice the process of CBT on their own. It will also provide at-home support for those already receiving therapy from a clinician.</pre>

									<h2>Our app will address a huge unmet need in mental healthcare.</h2>
									<p>Today, people struggling with anxiety have two options: clinical therapy and self-help solutions.</p>
									<!-- <p class="subsection">Clinical therapy can be very effective, but it traditionally requires many months of weekly, in-person sessions and costs thousands of dollars. To make matters worse, most therapists have months-long waitlists, and 570 counties in the US don’t even have a single mental healthcare provider. Even among those who have the time, money, and geographic luck to access a therapist, many never try due to the stigma associated with seeing a mental heath professional.</p> -->

										Our app will be a fraction of the price of traditional therapy, accessible anytime from the privacy of a smartphone or computer, and free of pathologizing clinical jargon.

										Our app is unique in that it reproduces the dynamic process of CBT. Designed by clinicians and scientists, our solution is based on the best-available clinical evidence. And like traditional therapy, our app becomes more personalized the more an individual uses it.
